    <p>
      To be honest, I can't say I always had passion for programming. I did try
      it a bit when I used to be younger at high school with some basic
      programming languages like java and during university with c++.
      <br />
      My strongest passion above everything else is building myself and
      developing my skills and character and never stay in the same place.
      <br />One of the reason why I chose to study programming right now is
      mainly because I felt stuck as a chef here in Israel after working many
      years abroad <br />
      I had the feeling I need to abandone completly and try something new,
      exciting and challenging in order to test myself and my abilities and
      acquire new skills.<br />
      <br />

        some pretty nice scars and burns and heaps of tattoos.</b
